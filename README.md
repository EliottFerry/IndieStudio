# IndieStudio
This was the last project of the second year of Epitech.
<br>
The goal of the project was to recreate a Bomberman, in 3D, using a specific graphic library, Raylib.
<br>
This was our first creation of a Entity Component System, and we had 2 months to do this project.
<br>
Done with 5 people including me.
